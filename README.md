You are asked to choose one from 3 closed doors. Behind two doors there is nothing (or a goat),
behind one door there is a prize. You will win whatever is behind the door you choose. 
After you choose a door, someone who knows what's behind each door opens one of the other two 
doors and reveals to you that it is empty (or has a goat). Then you are given the chance to 
change your selection and choose the unrevealed door. Should you stick with your first selection
or change in order to win the prize?

The reason why you should always change can be explained in two ways;
1) When you change your decision, you will always be changing the result. Meaning if 
you initially chose the prize door, after changing you'll have an empty door. If you 
chose an empty door, after changing you'll have the prize door.
For 3 doors, the chances of you choosing the prize door is 1/3 and choosing an empty door is 2/3. 
Meaning if you change, the chances of you changing to the prize door is 2/3 and changing 
to an empty door is 1/3, since changing doors always changes the result.

2) Imagine if there were 100 doors. You choose one door an someone opens 98 doors that are empty.
Would you change to the unrevealed door now?
