You are asked to choose one from 3 closed doors. Behind two doors there is nothing (or a goat),
behind one door there is a prize. After you choose a door, someone who knows what's behind each door
opens one of the other doors and reveals to you that it is empty (or has a goat). Then you are given the
chance to change your selection and choose the unrevealed door. Would you stick with your first
selection or change to win the prize?

The reason why you should always change can be explained in two ways;
1) When you change your decision, you will always be changing the result. Meaning if 
you initially chose the prize door, after changing you'll have an empty door. If you 
chose an empty door, after changing you'll have the prize door.
For 3 doors, the chances of you choosing the prize door is 1/3 and an empty door is 2/3, 
therefore after the change, the chances of you changing to the prize door is 2/3 and changing 
to an empty door is 1/3.

2) Imagine there were 100 doors. You choose one door an someone opens 98 doors that are empty.
Would you change to the unrevealed door now?
